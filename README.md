# Bangalore Home Price Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting home prices in Bangalore. Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, this project showcases a full-stack application from data preprocessing to a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions.

## Overview

This project encapsulates the end-to-end process of developing a predictive model, focusing on the data science pipeline including data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and deployment. The Flask-based web application allows users to estimate property prices based on various input parameters.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning and manipulation to handle missing values, remove outliers, and convert non-numeric to numeric data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extraction and selection of relevant features, creation of new features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Building**: Utilization of Linear Regression as the core predictive model due to its interpretability and efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation**: Application of cross-validation and GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters and ensure robustness.
- **Deployment**: Flask server for API handling and Nginx as a reverse proxy for deployment on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant features, handled missing values, and cleaned anomalies to ensure high-quality data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Analyzed various features such as total square feet, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms to create a comprehensive feature set.
- **Outlier Detection**: Implemented strategies to detect and remove outliers, ensuring the model's generalizability.
- **Model Selection and Tuning**: Linear Regression was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. Employed GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for model evaluation, ensuring the selection of a robust model.
- **Deployment**: Model serialized using pickle, with Flask serving the backend and Nginx as the reverse proxy for efficient request handling.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Science**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)
- **Back-end**: Flask
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2, Nginx
